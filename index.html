        <h1>Heart<br><span>Touching</span></h1>
        <p>Suriya is terrific as an advocate. He stuns all with his body language, mannerisms, and dialogues. He came with subtle and powerful expressions and his new look attracts all.The actor should be appreciated for picking up such scripts.
          Lijomal Jose who plays the tribal lady is astonishing in her role. The way she portrays a helpless pregnant lady fighting for her husband is terrific. In the same way, Manikandan, who plays Rajanna is also intense. Be it his look or the way he showcases the pain in all the investigation scenes looks realistic.
